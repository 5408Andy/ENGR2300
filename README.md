# ENGR2300
My code for Linear Algebra for Engineers at the University of Texas at Dallas

For my final ENGR – 2300 project, I decided to create a project about the “Calculation of DC currents in a linear circuit”. 
I chose this project because the problem relates to our degree as we are trying to become electrical/computer engineers.
Using linear algebra concepts and applying them when doing circuit analysis will increase the efficiency of getting unknown 
information from that circuit. Using Kirchhoff’s laws is essential when analyzing circuits and depending on the magnitude 
of a circuit, a lot of variables can be involved. Linear algebra’s solution to dealing with system of equations simplifies a 
lot of the math when dealing with circuit analysis.
